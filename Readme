## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates how to make a simple webpage **interactive** using **JavaScript**.  
It covers:
- 🎯 Event handling (clicks, form submission, etc.)
- ⚡ Interactive elements (light/dark mode, counter game)
- ✅ Form validation (custom JavaScript rules)

---

## ✨ Features

### 🌗 Light/Dark Mode
- Toggle between light and dark themes with one button.
- Implemented using `classList.toggle()`.

### 🎮 Counter Game
- Increase the score by clicking the **Increase** button.
- Reset the score with the **Reset** button.
- Demonstrates dynamic DOM updates with `.textContent`.

### 📋 Form Validation
- Validates input fields before submission:
  - Name: cannot be empty
  - Email: must match a regex pattern
  - Password: must be at least 6 characters
- Provides real-time feedback with **error ❌** or **success ✅** messages.
